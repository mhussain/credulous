# Credulous

**credulous** is a command line tool that manages **AWS (IAM) Credentials securely**. The aim is
to encrypt the credentials using a user's **public SSH Key** so that only the user who has the
corresponding **private SSH key** is able to see and use them. Furthermore the tool will also
enable the user to **easily rotate** their current credentials without breaking the user's current
workflow.

## Main Features

* Your IAM Credentials are securely encrypted on disk.
* Easy switching of Credentials between Accounts/Users.
* Painless Credential rotation.
* Enables rotation of Credentials by external application/service.
* No external runtime dependencies beyond minimal platform-specific shared libraries

## Installation

Download your [platform specific app](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/credulous/releases)


### Using brew

If you are using brew you can use:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realestate-com-au/credulous/master/brew/credulous.rb
```

### Bash Completion

Bash completion for subcommands and credentials is available (but waiting on inclusion in packages).

Till then, `source credulous.bash_completion` will do the trick. OSX users will need to `brew install bash_completion`


## Usage

Storing your current credentials in Credulous

    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_AWS_ID
    $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXX
    $ credulous save # Will ask credulous to store these credentials
    # saving credentials for user@account

Displaying a set of credentials from Credulous

    $ credulous source -a account -u user
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_AWS_ID
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXX


## Development

Download the dependencies

    $ go get -u # -u will update existing dependencies

Install the binary in your $GOBIN

    $ go install

## Tests

First we make sure we have our dependencies

    go get -t

Just go into this directory and either

    goconvey
    < Go to localhost:8080 in your browser >
